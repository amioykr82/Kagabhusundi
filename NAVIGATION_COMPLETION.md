## Implementation Details

### Common Pattern Used
- **Import**: `useNavigate` from `react-router-dom` and `ArrowLeft` from `lucide-react`
- **Hook**: `const navigate = useNavigate()`
- **Button**: Click handler using `navigate(-1)` for browser back functionality
- **Styling**: Consistent purple/white color scheme with hover effects

### Styling Variations by Page Type
1. **Standard Pages** (Profile): Purple text with hover effects
2. **Full-screen Pages** (Login, Register): White text with absolute positioning
3. **Complex Layout Pages** (ProfessionalHome): Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur

## Testing Status
- âœ… Frontend server running on http://localhost:3001
- âœ… Backend server running on http://localhost:8000
- âœ… All pages accessible and navigation working
- âœ… Back arrow functionality verified

## Navigation Flow
Users can now:
1. Navigate to any page from the home page
2. Use the back arrow to return to the previous page
3. Experience consistent navigation across all pages
4. Enjoy improved UX with visual feedback on hover

## Technical Notes
- All navigation uses browser history (`navigate(-1)`)
- Consistent icon library (Lucide React)
- Responsive design maintained
- Accessibility considerations included (hover states, clear labeling)

## Final Status
ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE**: All main pages now have back arrow navigation implemented with consistent styling and functionality. The Kagabhushundi astrology application now provides seamless navigation throughout the entire user journey.
